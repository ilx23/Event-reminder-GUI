## Introduction:

Welcome to the Event Reminder GUI project! This project provides a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for setting reminders for future events. Users can input the name and time of the event, and the application will remind them when the event is approaching.

## Features:

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** The GUI provides an intuitive interface for users to input the name and time of the event easily.

2. **Reminder Functionality:** Once the user inputs the event details, the application calculates the time remaining until the event and reminds the user when the event is approaching.
